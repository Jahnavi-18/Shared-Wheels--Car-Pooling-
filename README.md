# Shared-Wheels--Car-Pooling-
This project aims to develop a carpooling website that connects drivers with available seats to passengers looking for rides in the same direction. Carpooling offers a sustainable and cost-effective transportation solution by reducing the number of vehicles on the road, alleviating traffic congestion, and minimizing carbonÂ emissions.
